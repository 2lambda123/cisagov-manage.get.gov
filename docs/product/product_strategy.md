# .gov Product Strategy
Purpose: Clarify our focus for developing a new .gov TLD system and align it to the needs of its users, CISA's mission and standards, and the vision for the .gov program.

# .gov Mission Statement

.gov helps U.S.-based government organizations gain public trust by making .gov a well-known, reliable, and secure space online.

## Product Vision

CISA intends to create a modern, user-centered, responsive web application to enable .gov registrants to manage their domain’s registration lifecycle, DNS settings, and useful supporting services. The registrar should be the central .gov hub for CISA, supporting registrant management and tracking technical performance indicators for the TLD. For CISA and registrants, the registrar should help generate insights into the security of an organization’s internet-accessible systems.

## Problem Statements
U.S.-based government organizations and publicly controlled entities lack a clear, usable, and efficient way to apply, register, and a .gov domain and related infrastructure in order to build public trust of their website and communications.

CISA lacks a scalable, efficient, and secure method of managing the outreach and operations of .gov TLD program in order to facilitate government agencies building public trust of their website and communications.
