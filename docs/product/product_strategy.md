# .gov Product Strategy
Purpose: Clarify our focus for developing a new .gov TLD system and align it to the needs of its users, CISA's mission and standards, and the vision for the .gov program.

## Product Vision
_TBD - once we synthesize initial research and align as a product team_

## Primary, Secondary, Tertiary Users
### Primary:
* US-based government organizations and publicly-controlled entities who use or should use the registrar
  * _NOTE: Segmenting our audience is a separate conversation and so this intentionally broad as placeholder_
* CISA .gov administrators


## Problem Statements
_TBD - once we synthesize initial research and prioritize areas of need_

## Short-term Success for .gov
### Primary:
* A production-ready, modern .gov registrar that can replace the current system with improved user experience and operational efficiency
  * Built in the open
  * Meeting accessibility and testing standards
* A plan for developing capacity within the CISA organization going forward

### Secondary
* Having a clear understanding and definition of current state
* A plan for new product 
* A product plan that coordinates with other RFP actions

## Long-term Success for .gov
### Primary:
* Increase the number of governments, currently on non-.gov TLDs, to .gov
* Develop services to support “the security, privacy, reliability, accessibility, and speed of registered .gov internet domains” (DOTGOV ACT)
* Sustainable long-term skills and capacity to scale up the program

### Secondary
* Increase number of domain registrations
* Reduce time to get an application approved from 20 days to 1-2 business days
* Increase the percentage of domains which resolve to content
* Reduce time to ship changes to production
* Enable the discoverability of government services to the public and to domain registrants (DOTGOV ACT)
* A “simple and secure” registration process that works to “ensure that domains are registered and maintained only by authorized individuals” (DOTGOV ACT)
* Active .gov community of practice where members ask and answer questions, provide feedback, and where CISA can communicate with all .gov domain managers
* Demonstrated commitment to working in the open
* A clear role for humans or a call center to support registrant use cases

## Problems .gov registrar needs to solve (now)
_TBD - once we synthesize initial research and align as a product team_

## Problems NextGen doesn’t need to solve (next or later)
_TBD - once we synthesize initial research and align as a product team_

## Risks
_To be prioritized and posted_
