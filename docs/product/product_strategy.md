# .gov Product Strategy
Purpose: Clarify our focus for developing a new .gov TLD system and align it to the needs of its users, CISA's mission and standards, and the vision for the .gov program.

## Product Vision

CISA intends to create a modern, user-centered, responsive web application to enable .gov registrants to manage their domain’s registration lifecycle, DNS settings, and useful supporting services. The registrar should be the central .gov hub for CISA, supporting registrant management and tracking technical performance indicators for the TLD. For CISA and registrants, the registrar should help generate insights into the security of an organization’s internet-accessible systems.


## Primary, Secondary, Tertiary Users
### Primary:
* US-based government organizations and publicly-controlled entities who use or should use the registrar
  * _NOTE: Segmenting our audience is a separate conversation and so this intentionally broad as placeholder_
* CISA .gov administrators


## Problem Statements
U.S.-based government organizations and publicly controlled entities lack a clear, usable, and efficient way to apply, register, and a .gov domain and related infrastructure in order to build public trust of their website and communications.

CISA lacks a scalable, efficient, and secure method of managing the outreach and operations of .gov TLD program in order to facilitate government agencies building public trust of their website and communications.

## Short-term Success for .gov
* A production-ready, modern .gov registrar that can replace the current system with improved user experience and operational efficiency
  * Built in the open
  * Meeting accessibility and testing standards
* A plan for developing capacity within the CISA organization going forward

## Long-term Success for .gov
* Increase the number of governments, currently on non-.gov TLDs, to .gov
* Develop services to support “the security, privacy, reliability, accessibility, and speed of registered .gov internet domains” (DOTGOV ACT)
* Sustainable long-term skills and capacity to scale up the program

## Risks
_To be prioritized and posted_
