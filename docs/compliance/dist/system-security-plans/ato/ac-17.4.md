# ac-17.4 - \[catalog\] Privileged Commands and Access

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: organization-defined needs ; and

- \[b\] Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.

## Control guidance

Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.

## Control assessment-objective

the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: needs requiring remote access;
access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: needs requiring remote access;
the rationale for remote access is documented in the security plan for the system.
