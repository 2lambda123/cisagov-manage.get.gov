# ac-2.3 - \[catalog\] Disable Accounts

## Control Statement

Disable accounts within time period when the accounts:

- \[a\] Have expired;

- \[b\] Are no longer associated with a user or individual;

- \[c\] Are in violation of organizational policy; or

- \[d\] Have been inactive for time period.

## Control guidance

Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack surface of the system.

## Control assessment-objective

accounts are disabled within time period when the accounts have expired;
accounts are disabled within time period when the accounts are no longer associated with a user or individual;
accounts are disabled within time period when the accounts are in violation of organizational policy;
accounts are disabled within time period when the accounts have been inactive for time period.
