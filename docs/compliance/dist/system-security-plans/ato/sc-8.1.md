# sc-8.1 - \[catalog\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to No value found during transmission.

## Control guidance

Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes.

## Control assessment-objective

cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to No value found during transmission.
