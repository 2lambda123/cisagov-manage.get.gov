# sc-7.4 - \[catalog\] External Telecommunications Services

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

- \[b\] Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

- \[c\] Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

- \[d\] Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission or business need and duration of that need;

- \[e\] Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy frequency and remove exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or business need;

- \[f\] Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external networks;

- \[g\] Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane traffic from internal networks; and

- \[h\] Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.

## Control guidance

External telecommunications services can provide data and/or voice communications services. Examples of control plane traffic include Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and management protocols. See [SP 800-189](#f5edfe51-d1f2-422e-9b27-5d0e90b49c72) for additional information on the use of the resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) to protect BGP routes and detect unauthorized BGP announcements.

## Control assessment-objective

a managed interface is implemented for each external telecommunication service;
a traffic flow policy is established for each managed interface;
the confidentiality of the information being transmitted across each interface is protected;
the integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface is protected;
each exception to the traffic flow policy is documented with a supporting mission or business need and duration of that need;
exceptions to the traffic flow policy are reviewed frequency;
exceptions to the traffic flow policy that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or business need are removed;
unauthorized exchanges of control plan traffic with external networks are prevented;
information is published to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane traffic from internal networks;
unauthorized control plane traffic is filtered from external networks.
