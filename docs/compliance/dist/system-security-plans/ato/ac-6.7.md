# ac-6.7 - \[catalog\] Review of User Privileges

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Review frequency the privileges assigned to roles and classes to validate the need for such privileges; and

- \[b\] Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.

## Control guidance

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.

## Control assessment-objective

privileges assigned to roles and classes are reviewed frequency to validate the need for such privileges;
privileges are reassigned or removed, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.
