# au-4 - \[catalog\] Audit Log Storage Capacity

## Control Statement

Allocate audit log storage capacity to accommodate audit log retention requirements.

## Control guidance

Organizations consider the types of audit logging to be performed and the audit log processing requirements when allocating audit log storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit log storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of audit logging capability.

## Control assessment-objective

audit log storage capacity is allocated to accommodate audit log retention requirements.
