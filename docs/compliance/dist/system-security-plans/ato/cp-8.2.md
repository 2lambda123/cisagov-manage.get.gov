# cp-8.2 - \[catalog\] Single Points of Failure

## Control Statement

Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.

## Control guidance

In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is important to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for telecommunication services.

## Control assessment-objective

alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services are obtained.
