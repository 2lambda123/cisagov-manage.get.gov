# pe-13.1 - \[catalog\] Detection Systems â€” Automatic Activation and Notification

## Control Statement

Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify personnel or roles and emergency responders in the event of a fire.

## Control guidance

Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

## Control assessment-objective

fire detection systems that activate automatically are employed in the event of a fire;
fire detection systems that notify personnel or roles automatically are employed in the event of a fire;
fire detection systems that notify emergency responders automatically are employed in the event of a fire.
