# ac-2.2 - \[catalog\] Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management

## Control Statement

Automatically No value found temporary and emergency accounts after time period.

## Control guidance

Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

## Control assessment-objective
