# ac-18 - \[catalog\] Wireless Access

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and

- \[b\] Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control guidance

Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.

## Control assessment-objective

configuration requirements are established for each type of wireless access;
connection requirements are established for each type of wireless access;
implementation guidance is established for each type of wireless access;
each type of wireless access to the system is authorized prior to allowing such connections.
