# sc-28.1 - \[catalog\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on system components or media: information.

## Control guidance

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.

## Control assessment-objective

cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information at rest on system components or media;
cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of information at rest on system components or media.
