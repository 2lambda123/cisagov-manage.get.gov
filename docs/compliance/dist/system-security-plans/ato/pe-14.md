# pe-14 - \[catalog\] Environmental Controls

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Maintain No value found levels within the facility where the system resides at acceptable levels ; and

- \[b\] Monitor environmental control levels frequency.

## Control guidance

The provision of environmental controls applies primarily to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources (e.g., data centers, mainframe computer rooms, and server rooms). Insufficient environmental controls, especially in very harsh environments, can have a significant adverse impact on the availability of systems and system components that are needed to support organizational mission and business functions.

## Control assessment-objective

No value found levels are maintained at acceptable levels within the facility where the system resides;
environmental control levels are monitored frequency.
