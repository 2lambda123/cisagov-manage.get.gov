# ir-7.1 - \[catalog\] Automation Support for Availability of Information and Support

## Control Statement

Increase the availability of incident response information and support using automated mechanisms.

## Control guidance

Automated mechanisms can provide a push or pull capability for users to obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals may have access to a website to query the assistance capability, or the assistance capability can proactively send incident response information to users (general distribution or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response capabilities and support.

## Control assessment-objective

the availability of incident response information and support is increased using automated mechanisms.
