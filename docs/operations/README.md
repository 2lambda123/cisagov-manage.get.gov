# Operations
========================

Some basic information and setup steps are included in this README.

Instructions for specific actions can be found in our [runbooks](./runbooks/).

## Continuous Delivery

We use a [cloud.gov service account](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account/) to deploy from this repository to cloud.gov with a SpaceDeveloper user.

## Authenticating to Cloud.gov via the command line

You'll need the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloud.gov/getting-started/setup/).

We use the V7 Cloud Foundry CLI.

```shell
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
```

After authenticating, make sure you are targeting the correct org and space!

```bash
cf spaces
cf target -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>
```

## Database

In sandbox, created with `cf create-service aws-rds micro-psql getgov-ENV-database`.

Binding the database in `manifest-<ENVIRONMENT>.json` automatically inserts the connection string into the environment as `DATABASE_URL`.

[Cloud.gov RDS documentation](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/relational-database/).

# Deploy

We have two environments: `unstable` and `staging`. Developers can deploy locally to unstable whenever they want. However, only our CD service can deploy to `staging`, and it does so on every commit to `main`. This is to ensure that we have a "golden" environment to point to, and can still test things out in an unstable space. You should make sure all of the USWDS assets are compiled and collected before deploying to unstable. To deploy locally to `unstable`:

```bash
# Compile and collect the assets
docker-compose run node npx gulp compile
docker-compose run node npx gulp copyAssets
docker-compose run app ./manage.py collectstatic

# Deploy to unstable
cf target -o cisa-getgov-prototyping -s unstable
cf push getgov-unstable -f ops/manifests/manifest-unstable.yaml
cf run-task getgov-unstable --command 'python manage.py migrate' --name migrate
```
Alternatively, you could run the `deploy.sh` script in the `/src` directory to build the assets and deploy to `unstable`. Similarly, you could run `build.sh` script to just compile and collect the assets without deploying.


## Serving static assets
We are using [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/index.html) plugin to serve our static assets on cloud.gov. This plugin is added to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in our apps `settings.py`.

Note that itâ€™s a good idea to run `collectstatic` locally or in the docker container before pushing files up to `unstable`. This is because `collectstatic` relies on timestamps when deciding to whether to overwrite the existing assets in `/public`. Due the way files are uploaded, the compiled css in the `/assets/css` folder on `unstable` will have a slightly earlier timestamp than the files in `/public/css`, and consequently running `collectstatic` on`unstable` will not update `public/css` as you may expect. For convenience, both the `deploy.sh` and `build.sh` scripts will take care of that.
