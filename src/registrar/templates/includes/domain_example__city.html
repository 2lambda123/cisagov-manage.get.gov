<p> Most city domains must include the two-letter state abbreviation or clearly spell out the state name. Using phrases like “City of” or “Town of” is optional.</p>
<p>Examples:
  <ul class="usa-list">
    <li>www.BlufftonIndiana.gov</li>
    <li>www.CityofEudoraKS.gov</li>
    <li>www.WallawallaWA.gov</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> Some cities don’t have to refer to their state.
  <ul class="usa-list">
    <li> City names that are not shared by any other U.S. city, town, or village can be requested without referring to the state. We use the Census Bureau’s National Places Gazetteer Files to determine if names are unique. </li>
    <li>Certain cities are so well-known that they may not require a state reference to communicate location. We use the list of U.S. “dateline cities” in the Associated Press Stylebook to make this determination.</li>
    <li>The 50 largest cities, as measured by population according to the Census Bureau, can have .gov domain names that don’t refer to their state.</li>
  </ul>
