  <p>.Gov domain names are intended for use on the internet. They should be registered
  with an intent to deploy services, not simply to reserve a name. .Gov domains should
  not be registered for primarily internal use.</p>

  <p>Describe the reason for your domain request. Explain how you plan to use this
  domain. Will you use it for a website and/or email? Are you moving your website from
  another top-level domain (like .com or .org)? Read about <a href="{% url 'todo' %}">activities that
  are prohibited on .gov domains.</a></p>
