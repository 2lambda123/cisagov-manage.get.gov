<p>
Domain invitations contain all individuals who have been invited to manage a .gov domain. 
Invitations are sent via email, and the recipient must log in to the registrar to officially 
accept and become a domain manager. 
</p>

<p>
An “invited” status indicates that the recipient has not logged in to the registrar since the invitation was sent. 
A “received” status indicates that the recipient has logged in.
</p>

<p>
If an invitation is created in this table, an email will not be sent. 
To have an email sent, go to the domain in <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_domain_changelist' %}">Domains</a>, 
click the “Manage domain” button, and add a domain manager. 
</p>
