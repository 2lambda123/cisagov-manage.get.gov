<p>
Contacts include anyone who has access to the registrar (known as “users”) and anyone listed in a domain request, 
including other employees and authorizing officials. 
Only contacts who have access to the registrar will have 
a corresponding record within the <a class="usa-button usa-button--unstyled text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_user_changelist' %}">Users</a> table.
Updating someone’s contact information here will not affect that person’s Login.gov information.
