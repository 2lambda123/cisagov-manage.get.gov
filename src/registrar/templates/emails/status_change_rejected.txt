REJECTION REASON{% endif %}

Your domain request was rejected because the purpose you provided did not meet our

{% elif application.rejection_reason == 'requestor' %}
Your domain request was rejected because we don’t believe you’re eligible to request a 
.gov domain on behalf of {{ application.organization_name }}. You must be a government employee, or be 
working on behalf of a government organization, to request a .gov domain.


DEMONSTRATE ELIGIBILITY
If you can provide more information that demonstrates your eligibility, or you want to 
discuss further, reply to this email.
{% elif application.rejection_reason == 'second_domain_reasoning' %}
Your domain request was rejected because {{ application.organization_name }} has a .gov domain. Our 
practice is to approve one domain per online service per government organization. We 
evaluate additional requests on a case-by-case basis. You did not provide sufficient 
justification for an additional domain.

<https://get.gov/domains/before/#one-domain-per-service>. 

If you have questions or comments, reply to this email.
{% elif application.rejection_reason == 'contacts_or_organization_legitimacy' %}
Your domain request was rejected because we could not verify the organizational 
contacts you provided. If you have questions or comments, reply to this email.
{% elif application.rejection_reason == 'organization_eligibility' %}
Your domain request was rejected because we determined that {{ application.organization_name }} is not 
eligible for a .gov domain. .Gov domains are only available to official U.S.-based 
government organizations. 


DEMONSTRATE ELIGIBILITY
If you can provide documentation that demonstrates your eligibility, reply to this email. 
This can include links to (or copies of) your authorizing legislation, your founding 
charter or bylaws, or other similar documentation. Without this, we can’t approve a 
.gov domain for your organization. Learn more about eligibility for .gov domains 
<https://get.gov/domains/eligibility/>. 
{% elif application.rejection_reason == 'naming_requirements' %}
Your domain request was rejected because it does not meet our naming requirements. 
Domains should uniquely identify a government organization and be clear to the 
general public. Learn more about naming requirements for your type of organization 
<https://get.gov/domains/choosing/>.
