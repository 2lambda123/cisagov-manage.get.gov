Hi {{ application.submitter.first_name }}.

Congratulations! Your .gov domain request has been approved.

DOMAIN REQUESTED: {{ application.requested_domain.name }}
REQUEST RECEIVED ON: {{ application.submission_date|date }}
STATUS: Approved

You can manage your approved domain on the .gov registrar. <https://manage.get.gov>

----------------------------------------------------------------

ADD DOMAIN NAME SERVER INFORMATION
Before your .gov domain can be used, you’ll first need to connect it to a Domain Name System (DNS) hosting service. At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services. 

After you’ve set up hosting, you’ll need to enter your name server information on the .gov registrar.

- Finding a DNS hosting service <https://get.gov/domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services>
- Adding name servers <https://get.gov/help/domain-management/#manage-dns-name-servers>.


ADD DOMAIN MANAGERS, SECURITY EMAIL
Currently, you’re the only person who can manage this domain. Please keep your contact information updated. 

We strongly recommend adding other domain managers who can serve as additional contacts. We also recommend providing a security email that the public can use to report security issues on your domain. You can add domain managers and a security email on the .gov registrar.
