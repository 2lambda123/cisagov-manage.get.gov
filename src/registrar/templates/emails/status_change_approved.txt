REQUEST RECEIVED ON: {{ application.submission_date|date }}
REQUEST #: {{ application.id }}
STATUS: In review

Now that your .gov domain has been approved, there are a few more things to do before your domain can be used. 


YOU MUST ADD DOMAIN NAME SERVER INFORMATION

Before your .gov domain can be used, you have to connect it to your Domain Name System (DNS) hosting service. At this time, we donâ€™t provide DNS hosting services.
Go to the domain management page to add your domain name server information <https://manage.get.gov/domain/{{ application.approved_domain.id }}/nameservers>.

Get help with adding your domain name server information <https://get.gov/help/domain-management/#manage-dns-information-for-your-domain>.


ADD DOMAIN MANAGERS, SECURITY EMAIL

We strongly recommend that you add other points of contact who will help manage your domain. We also recommend that you provide a security email. This email will allow the public to report security issues on your domain. Security emails are made public. 

Go to the domain management page to add domain contacts <https://manage.get.gov/domain/{{ application.approved_domain.id }}/your-contact-information> and a security email <https://manage.get.gov/domain/{{ application.approved_domain.id }}/security-email>.
