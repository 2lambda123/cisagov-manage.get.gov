Hello from .gov.

Our new domain management system—the .gov registrar—is now available. The organization, contacts, and DNS information for your .gov domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %} have been transferred to our new registrar. 

Your .gov domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %}:
{% for domain in domains %} - {{ domain }}
{% endfor %}
If you’re not affiliated with the above domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %} or think you received this message in error, let us know in a reply to this email. 


CREATE A LOGIN.GOV ACCOUNT

You can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. Access is now managed through Login.gov, a simple and secure process for signing into many government services with one account. Follow these steps to create your Login.gov account <https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/>. 

When creating an account, you’ll need to provide the same email address you used to log in to the old registrar. That will ensure your domains are linked to your Login.gov account. 

If you need help finding the email you used in the past, let us know in a reply to this email.


CHECK YOUR .GOV DOMAIN CONTACTS

This is a good time to check who has access to your .gov domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %}. The admin, technical, and billing contacts listed for your domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %} in our old system also received this email. However, in our new registrar, these contacts are all considered “domain managers.” We no longer have the admin, technical, and billing roles, and you aren’t limited to three domain managers like in the old system. 
    1. Once you have your Login.gov account, sign in to the new registrar at <https://manage.get.gov>
    2. Click the “Manage” link next to your .gov domain, then click on “Domain managers” to see who has access to your domain. 
    3. If any of these users should not have access to your domain, let us know in a reply to this email.

After verifying who has access to your domain{% if domains|length > 1 %}s{% endif %}, we also suggest reviewing your contact information and organization mailing address to ensure those are up to date. 


DOMAIN EXPIRATION DATES EXTENDED BY ONE YEAR

Expiration dates for .gov domains in good standing have been extended for one year. Expiration dates won't be shown in the new registrar yet. 


SOMETHING WRONG?

If you think you received this message in error or have a question, let us know in a reply to this email.
