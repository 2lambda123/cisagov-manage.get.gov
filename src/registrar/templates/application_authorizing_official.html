    Who is the authorizing official for your organization?
  </h2>

<p>Your authorizing official is the person within your organization who can authorize your domain request. This person must be in a role of significant, executive responsibility within the organization.</p>

<p>We typically donâ€™t reach out to the authorizing official, but if contact is necessary, our practice is to coordinate first with you, the requestor.
