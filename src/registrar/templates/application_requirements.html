  <p>The .gov domain exists to support a broad diversity of government missions and
  public initiatives. Generally, the .gov registry does not review or audit how
  government organizations use their domains. However, misuse of an individual .gov
  domain can reflect upon the integrity of the entire .gov space. There are categories
  of misuse that are statutorily prohibited or abusive in nature.</p>

  <h2>Prohibited activities for .gov domains</h2>

  <h3>Commercial purposes </h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used for commercial purposes, such as advertising
  benefitting private individuals or entities.</p>

  <h3>Political campaigns</h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used for political campaigns.</p>

  <h3>Illegal content</h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used to distribute or promote material whose distribution
  violates applicable law.</p>

  <h3>Malicious cyber activity </h3>

  <p>.Gov is a trusted and safe space. .Gov domains must not distribute malware, host
  open redirects, or otherwise engage in malicious cyber activity.</p>

  <h2>Required activities for .gov domain registrants </h2>

  <h3>Keep your contact information updated</h3>

  <p>As a .gov domain registrant, maintain current and accurate contact information in the
  .gov registrar. We strongly recommend that you create and use a security contact.</p>

  <h3>Be responsive if we contact you</h3>

  <p>Registrants should respond in a timely manner to communications about required and
  prohibited activities.</p>

  <h2>Domains can be suspended or terminated for violations</h2>

  <p>The .gov program may need to suspend or terminate a domain registration for
  violations. Registrants should respond in a timely manner to communications about
  prohibited activities.</p>

  <p>When we discover a violation, we will make reasonable efforts to contact a
  registrant, including:
    <ul class="usa-list"> 
      <li>Emails to domain contacts </li>
      <li>Phone calls to domain contacts</li>
      <li>Email or phone call to the authorizing official</li>
      <li>Emails or phone calls to the government organization, a parent organization,
        or affiliated entities</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>We understand the critical importance of the availability of .gov domains.
  Suspending or terminating a .gov domain is reserved only for prolonged, unresolved
  serious violations where the registrant is non-responsive. We will make extensive
  efforts to contact registrants and to identify potential solutions, and will make
  reasonable accommodations for remediation timelines proportional to the severity of
  the issue.</p>

  <h2>Requirements for authorizing officials</h2>

  <p>Your authorizing official is the person within your organization who can authorize
  your domain request. This is generally the highest ranking or highest elected official
  in your organization.</p>

  <h3>Executive branch federal agencies</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from executive branch agencies must be authorized by CIOs or agency
  heads.</p> 

  <p>Domain requests from executive branch agencies are subject to guidance issued by
  the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.</p>

  <h3>Judicial branch federal agencies</h3>

  <p>Domain requests for judicial branch agencies, except the U.S. Supreme Court, must
  be authorized by the director or CIO of the Administrative Office (AO) of the United
  States Courts.</p>

  <p>Domain requests from the U.S. Supreme Court must be authorized by the director of
  information technology for the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

  <h3>Legislative branch federal agencies</h3>

  <h4>U.S. Senate</h4>

  <p>Domain requests from the U.S. Senate must come from the Senate Sergeant at Arms.</p>

  <h4>U.S. House of Representatives</h4>

  <p>Domain requests from the U.S. House of Representatives must come from the House
  Chief Administrative Officer.</p>

  <h4>Other legislative branch agencies</h4>

  <p>Domain requests from legislative branch agencies must come from the agency’s head
  or CIO.</p>

  <p>Domain requests from legislative commissions must come from the head of the
  commission, or the head or CIO of the parent agency, if there is one.</p>

  <h3>Interstate</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from interstate organizations must be authorized by the
  highest-ranking executive (president, director, chair, or equivalent) or one of the
  state’s governors or CIOs.</p>

  <h3>U.S. states and territories</h3>

  <h4>States and territories: executive branch</h4>

  <p>Domain requests from states and territories must be authorized by the governor or
  the state CIO.</p>

  <h4>States and territories: judicial and legislative branches</h4>

  tribal chiefs as noted by the
  <a href="https://www.bia.gov/service/tribal-leaders-directory">Bureau of Indian
  Affairs</a>.</p>

  <h3>Counties</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from counties must be authorized by the chair of the county
  commission or the equivalent highest elected official.</p>

  <h3>Cities</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from cities must be authorized by the mayor or the equivalent
  highest elected official.</p>

  <h3>Special districts</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from special districts must be authorized by the highest-ranking
  executive (president, director, chair, or equivalent) or state CIOs for state-based
  organizations.</p>

  <h3>School districts</h3>

  <p>Domain requests from school district governments must be authorized by the highest-ranking
  executive (the chair of a school district’s board or a superintendent).</p>

  <h2>Requirements for .gov domain names</h2>

  <p>.Gov domains must:
    <ul class="usa-list"> 
      <li>Be available</li>
      <li>Be unique</li>
      <li>Relate to your organization’s name, location, and/or services</li>
      <li>Be clear to the general public. Your domain name must not be easily confused
        with other organizations.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>HSTS preloading</h2>

  <p>The .gov program will preload all newly registered .gov domains for HTTP Strict
  Transport Security (HSTS).</p> 

  <p>HSTS is a simple and widely-supported standard that protects visitors by ensuring
  that their browsers always connect to a website over HTTPS. HSTS removes the need to
  redirect users from http:// to https:// URLs. (This redirection is a security risk
  that HSTS eliminates.)</p>

  <p>HSTS preloading impacts web traffic only. Once a domain is on the HSTS preload
  list, modern web browsers will enforce HTTPS connections for all websites hosted on
  the .gov domain. Users will not be able to click through warnings to reach a site.
  Non-web uses of .gov (email, VPN, APIs, etc.) are not affected.</p>
