## Access

### Steps for the onboardee
- [ ] Setup [commit signing in Github](#setting-up-commit-signing) and with git locally.
- [ ] [Create a cloud.gov account](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/accounts/)
- [ ] Email github@cisa.dhs.gov (cc: Cameron) to add you to the [CISA Github organization](https://github.com/getgov) and [.gov Team](https://github.com/orgs/cisagov/teams/gov).
- [ ] Ensure you can login to your cloud.gov account via the CLI
```bash
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov  --sso
```
- [ ] Have an admin add you to cloud.gov org and set up your [sandbox developer space](#setting-up-developer-sandbox). Ensure you can deploy to your sandbox space.
- [ ] Have an admin add you to our login.gov sandbox team (`.gov Registrar`) via the [dashboard](https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/).

 **Note:** As mentioned in the [Login documentation](https://developers.login.gov/testing/), the sandbox Login account is different account from your regular, production Login account. If you have not created a Login account for the sandbox before, you will need to create a new account first.

- [ ] Optional- add yourself as a codeowner if desired. See the [Developer readme](https://github.com/cisagov/getgov/blob/main/docs/developer/README.md) for how to do this and what it does.

### Steps for the onboarder
- [ ] Add the onboardee to cloud.gov org (cisa-dotgov) 
- [ ] Setup a [developer specific space for the new developer](#setting-up-developer-sandbox)
